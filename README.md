# DeepDefenseReplication

In this project, we replicated the MLP part of [Deep Defense: Training DNNs with Improved Adversarial Robustness](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7324-deep-defense-training-dnns-with-improved-adversarial-robustness). We used the `MNIST-Fashion` dataset and were able to replicate the results shown in the paper.

This deep learning final project is done in collaboration of Linchen Deng, Yan Zhao, Yimo Zhang. Thank you all for being supportive and constructive during the project!

# Usage

Git clone and run `python main.py` to see the results.
